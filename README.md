## Executive Summary

AReL's Monitoring and Evaluation Unit is planning Cohort 7 and needs to know what worked and
what did not across the first six cohorts. Using MySQL, I analysed enrolment and attendance
records for every cohort and course to find where and when students disengage. Attendance
is weakest on Fridays and dips about a third of the way through every course, and students
who go on to drop out show absence building month by month rather than stopping suddenly.
These findings lead to recommendations on scheduling, mid-course support and record keeping
for Cohort 7. The dataset is simulated, so the results show the method working, not what is
true of AReL's real cohorts.

**Key Highlights:**

- Friday attendance is 53.5%, against 63.2% on Monday, and Friday is the weakest day in all
  six cohorts.
- Attendance opens at 67%, falls to 53% about a third of the way through a course, and ends
  at 47%. The mid-course dip appears in all nine course records.
- Students who eventually dropped went from 29.7% absence in their first month to 70.8% in
  their seventh, while students who completed stayed between about 24% and 36%.


## Business Problem

AReL runs cohort based skills training, with several courses running side by side in each
cohort. Six cohorts have run since 2023. Before Cohort 7 is finalised, the M&E Unit wants to
use what the first six cohorts show to decide what to keep, what to change and what to fix
in how records are kept.

The central question: **what do attendance and enrolment patterns across Cohorts 1 to 6
say about how Cohort 7 should be scheduled, supported and recorded?**

This is a program wide analysis. It is not about any single course.

**Problem Visual (Concept): the cohorts are not equally easy to evaluate**

| Cohort | Class days | Enrolments | Enrolments with Unknown status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cohort 1 | Mon, Wed, Fri | 29 | 6.9% |
| Cohort 2 | Mon, Wed, Fri | 107 | 9.3% |
| Cohort 3 | Mon, Wed, Fri | 119 | 13.4% |
| Cohort 4 | Mon, Wed, Fri | 99 | 57.6% |
| Cohort 5 | Mon, Wed, Fri | 88 | 62.5% |
| Cohort 6 | Mon to Fri | 123 | 30.9% |

**Initial Insight:** In Cohorts 4 and 5, more than half of all enrolments have no recorded
outcome. Any question about completion is much harder to answer for those cohorts, so
attendance became the main measure.

## Methodology

**Analytical Approach**

- Reviewed how the seven tables connect before writing any analysis.
- Checked data quality first (enrolment status, missing contact details, unrecorded
  sessions) and decided how to handle each gap.
- Defined the measures before using them:
  - **Attendance rate:** sessions marked Present or Late, divided by all recorded sessions.
  - **Absence rate:** sessions marked Absent, divided by all recorded sessions.
- Answered each business question with its own SQL script, covering every cohort and course.
- Checked surprising results before trusting them, including splitting one result by
  student group to see whether something else was driving it.

**Assumptions**

- Present and Late count as attended. Absent and Excused count as not attended for
  attendance rate. For absence rate, only Absent counts, so Excused is not treated as absence.
- Sessions marked Not Recorded are left out of every rate. I do not guess whether the
  student was there.
- Unknown enrolment status is kept as its own group. It is never assumed to mean Completed
  or Dropped.
- In the month by month analysis, a "month" is a block of 30 days counted from the first
  class of that course and cohort, not a calendar month.
- "Stage of course" compares sessions by how far through their own course they fall, using
  each course and cohort's own first and last recorded class date.
- Every scheduled weekday between a cohort's start and end date is treated as a class day.
  No public holidays, cancelled classes or breaks are modelled.
- Instructor periods come from the start and end dates in the assignment table.

**Technical Implementation**

- **Data checks:** `01_data_quality_checks.sql` counts statuses, missing contact details and
  unrecorded sessions.
- **Day and month patterns:** `02` and `03` group attendance by day of week and by calendar
  month.
- **Course stage:** `04` uses two CTEs and `DATEDIFF` to place every session in one of ten
  stages of its own course run.
- **Schedule comparison:** `05` compares the three day and five day schedules.
- **Absence pattern before dropout:** `06` tracks absence rate by month of enrolment for each
  final status.
- **Instructor changes:** `07` compares attendance before and after each mid-course handoff.
- **Course and cohort ranking:** `08` ranks every course and cohort combination, using
  `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` so each student is counted once.

## Skills

**Tools and Techniques Used**

- **SQL (MySQL 8.0 or later):** CTEs, multi table JOINs, GROUP BY and HAVING, CASE WHEN,
  COUNT(DISTINCT), date functions (DATEDIFF, DATE_FORMAT), casting.
- **Analysis methods:** data quality assessment, metric definition, trend analysis over
  calendar time and over a course's own timeline, before and after comparison, and checking
  a result by splitting it into subgroups.
- **Business concepts:** cohort evaluation, engagement and dropout patterns, early warning
  indicators, record keeping and data governance.
- **Communication:** turning results into recommendations and stating limits plainly.

## Results and Business Recommendations

**Key Results**

- **Friday is the weakest day.** 53.5% attendance on Fridays, 63.2% on Mondays. Friday is the
  weakest day in all six cohorts and in seven of the nine course records. In the other two,
  Thursday is a little lower.
- **Every course dips about a third of the way through.** Attendance opens at 67.4%, drops to
  53.4% at the 30 to 40 percent mark, recovers to about 66% around the middle, then slides to
  47.0% at the end. The dip appears in all nine course records. How far the late slide goes
  varies: Full Stack Development ends near 36%, while Full Stack Development and AI
  Engineering ends near 59%.
- **The lowest months come at the end of Cohorts 4 and 5.** Attendance falls to 34.1% in
  August 2025 and 31.4% in February 2026. March 2026 reads 32.2% but rests on very few
  sessions.
- **The five day week made little difference.** 58.0% attendance under the five day schedule
  (Cohort 6) against 58.9% under the three day schedule (Cohorts 1 to 5). This rests on one
  cohort.
- **Dropout is preceded by a build up.** For students who dropped, absence rose from 29.7% in
  the first month to 45.5% in the fifth, 63.9% in the sixth and 70.8% in the seventh.
  Completed students stayed between about 24% and 36%, and Active students between about 25%
  and 38%. Both showed a small bump in the third month, matching the mid-course dip, but
  neither kept climbing.
- **Unknown status behaves like Dropped.** Students with an Unknown status follow almost the
  same rising curve as students marked Dropped (26.4% in the first month, 68.2% in the
  seventh). This could mean some Unknown records are students who disengaged without it
  being recorded. It could also be a feature of how this simulated data was built, so it is
  a question to test on real records, not a finding.
- **The one large instructor result does not hold up.** Attendance in Data Analysis,
  Cohort 4 fell from 63.9% to 36.3% after an instructor change, while two other changes
  barely moved (60.3% to 60.0%, and 64.7% to 62.6%). But 14 of the 19 enrolments in that
  course have an Unknown status. Split by status, Active students went up after the change
  (61.7% to 64.9%), while Unknown students fell from 63.7% to 28.0% and Dropped students from
  75.5% to 38.3%. The drop follows the students who lose attendance late in a course, not
  the instructor change. With three changes in total, the data cannot say whether
  instructor changes affect attendance.
- **The weakest offerings cluster by cohort, not by course.** Of the eight lowest attendance
  rates, six belong to Cohorts 4 and 5 and two to Cohort 6. Every Cohort 4 and Cohort 5
  offering is below 60%, while Cohorts 1 to 3 range from 59.2% to 65.2%. These are also the
  cohorts with the most Unknown statuses.
- **Completion rates cannot be trusted for Cohorts 4 to 6.** 57.6% of Cohort 4 enrolments,
  62.5% of Cohort 5 and 30.9% of Cohort 6 have no recorded outcome, and Cohort 6 is still
  running. Across all cohorts, 178 of 565 enrolments (31.5%) are Unknown.

**Data quality at a glance:** 75.0% of students are missing an email and 75.0% are missing a
phone number. 1,873 of 58,944 attendance rows (3.2%) are Not Recorded.

**Business Recommendations**

1. **Reduce reliance on Friday sessions.** Friday is the weakest day in every cohort and in
   most courses. Move one session earlier in the week, or make Friday a lighter session.
2. **Plan a check-in at the 30 to 40 percent mark of every course.** The dip appears in all
   nine course records, so support timed just before it is likely to help across the program.
3. **Watch monthly absence for each student as an early warning.** Look for a sustained climb
   over several months, not one bad month, since completers also have a bump in month three.
   Test the rule on students whose outcome is not yet known before relying on it.
4. **Close out every enrolment at the end of each cohort.** More than half of Cohort 4 and
   Cohort 5 enrolments have no outcome, which blocks any reliable completion analysis. Record
   Completed or Dropped for every student before the next cohort starts.
5. **Treat the five day schedule as undecided.** It shows no clear cost or benefit yet, and
   one cohort is not enough to settle it.
6. **Do not judge instructor changes from this data.** Record enrolment outcomes properly,
   then compare like with like across more handoffs before drawing conclusions.

## Limitations

- **The data is simulated.** Nothing here has been checked against real AReL records, and
  simulated patterns are only as real as the way the data was built.
- **The Unknown and Dropped similarity may come from the simulation itself.** It should not
  be treated as evidence about real records.
- **The instructor result is confounded.** Only three handoffs exist, and the largest drop
  overlaps with a course where most students have an Unknown status.
- **The schedule comparison rests on one cohort** under the five day pattern.
- **Attendance rate treats Excused as not attended.** A different rule would change the
  numbers.
- **The early warning idea looks backwards.** It shows dropouts had rising absence. It has
  not been tested on who will drop next.
- **No holidays or cancelled classes are modelled,** which a real attendance record would
  contain.
- **The very last month of some courses rests on few sessions,** so those points are less
  steady than the rest.

## Next Steps

- **Repeat the analysis on real records** once statuses have been cleaned, and check which of
  these patterns survive.
- **Test the early warning rule** on a cohort where outcomes are still unknown, and measure
  how many students it flags correctly and incorrectly.
- **Revisit the schedule question** when Cohort 7 gives a second cohort to compare.
- **Rerun the instructor comparison** once statuses are recorded, so students with the same
  status can be compared before and after a change.
- **Build a dashboard** (for example in Power BI) so the M&E Unit can filter by cohort,
  course and day without writing SQL.
